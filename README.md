Hello World - First repo for testing
Hello there! I m just writing something to check that, how the commits and merge are working.

Planning to commit this change by using sourcetree

Adding the second line. But wanted to commit only the previous line.
Adding new line from github.

Added for checking the changes in slack bot

Added this line directly on the new branch and this can be reflected in slack by switch unauth mode.

Adding new line for checking the git amend command
